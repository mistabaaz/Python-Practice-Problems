    <summary>Python Problem 1</summary>
  <br>
  Problem : Input age or (year of birth) from the user and tell them the year when they will become 100 years old.
Also user may provide year(optional) and your program able to tell the age of user on that particular year.
<br><br>
    
For example:

```
Enter age or year of birth: 17
enter year on which you want to know your age(Optional): 2004
You will be 100 years old in 2106
You are not born in the year 2004 :)
```
  <br>
    
Notes:
- User can input any of the age(or year of birth) and your program should run on both types of input.
- if user enter the year (for which year he want to know his age) which is less than his birth year than your program should say (you are not born on that year)
- means you have to handle some types of error even if user entered something wrong!

    <summary>Python Problem 2</summary>
  <br>
  Problem : Harry got n number of apples and he want to distribute it in some students. Your program should ask the range of students and give output as how much apple can he distribute to the students.Your program should also suggest them to buy or donate apple if it is less or excessive respectively.
<br><br>
    
For example:

```
enter how many apples harry got : 4
enter range of students :
enter minimum no. of Students : 1
enter maximum no. of students : 3
yes , harry can divide 4 apples in 1 students.
each students will get 4 apples
yes , harry can divide 4 apples in 2 students.
each students will get 2 apples
yes , harry can divide 4 apples in 3 students.
but you have to donate 1 apples (>_<)
then , each students will get 1 apples
```
  <br>
    
Notes:
- You have to handle all types of error like
- if there are 4 apples and you have to distribute in 5 students so your program shoud say harry have to buy 1 apple more and then everyone can get 1 apple.
- and if there are 5 apples and you have to distribute in 2 students then your program should say donate 1 apple to someone needy then everyone get 2 apples.

    <summary>Python Problem 3</summary>
  <br>  
    
  Problem : Take a list of diffrent food from the user and reverse the list using three methods.
  - using slicing method
  - using a built-in function
  - using for loop
    
Note : reverse list have to be same for all the three mehods

    <summary>Python Problem 4</summary>
  <br>  
    
  Problem : Take input from user (as many as user wants) and print next palindrome numbers.
<br><br>
    
For example:

```
enter how many numbers you want to input : 4
enter number for 1 test case :8
enter number for 2 test case :99
enter number for 3 test case :43
enter number for 4 test case :67

after 8 next pallindrome number is 9
after 99 next pallindrome number is 101
after 43 next pallindrome number is 44
after 67 next pallindrome number is 77
```    
  <br>
    
Notes : 
- User can provide numbers as much as they want to be.
- Pallindrome number is a number which looks same from reading both the sides.
- for example : 111,44,77,121 etc they readed same from both sides

    <summary>Python Problem 5</summary>
  <br>  
    
  Problem : Take a list from user and pallindromify the list.
<br><br>
    
For example:

```
enter no of elements in list :4
enter element number 1:54
enter element number 2:7
enter element number 3:96
enter element number 4:4
pallindromified list is :
[55, 7, 99, 4]
```    
  <br>
    
Notes : 
- palindromify the numbers of the list only if the number is greater than 10.
- palindromify means next pallindrome of the given number.
