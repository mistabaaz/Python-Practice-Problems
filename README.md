    <summary>Python Problem 1</summary>
  <br>
  Problem : Input age or (year of birth) from the user and tell them the year when they will become 100 years old.
Also user may provide year(optional) and your program able to tell the age of user on that particular year.
<br><br>
    
For example:

```
Enter age or year of birth: 17
Enter a year for calculating age on that year(Optional): 2004
You will be 100 years old in 2106
You are not born on that year :)
```
  <br>
    
Notes:
- User can input any of the age(or year of birth) and your program should run on both types of input.
- if user enter the year (for which year he want to know his age) which is less than his birth year than your program should say (you are not born on that year)
- means you have to handle some types of error even if user entered something wrong!

  <br>
  Problem : Harry got n number of apples and he want to distribute it in some students. Your program should ask the range of students and give output as how much apple can he distribute to the students.Your program should also suggest them to buy or donate apple if it is less or excessive respectively.
<br><br>
    
For example:

```
enter how many apples harry got : 4
enter range of students :
enter minimum no. of Students : 1
enter maximum no. of students : 3
yes , harry can divide 4 apples in 1 students.
each students will get 4 apples
yes , harry can divide 4 apples in 2 students.
each students will get 2 apples
yes , harry can divide 4 apples in 3 students.
but you have to donate 1 apples (>_<)
then , each students will get 1 apples
```
  <br>
    
Notes:
- You have to handle all types of error like
- if there are 4 apples and you have to distribute in 5 students so your program shoud say harry have to buy 1 apple more and then everyone can get 1 apple.
- and if there are 5 apples and you have to distribute in 2 students then your program should say donate 1 apple to someone needy then everyone get 2 apples.
