  Problem : Input age or (year of birth) from the user and tell them the year when they will become 100 years old.
Also user may provide year(optional) and your program able to tell the age of user on that particular year.

Note:
- User can input any of the age(or year of birth) and your program should run on both types of input.
- if user enter the year (for which year he want to know his age) which is less than his birth year than your program should say (you are not born on that year)
- means you have to handle some types of error even if user entered something wrong!
